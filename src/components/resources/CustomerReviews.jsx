      review: "After DuctBuddy cleaned our entire home's air duct system, my daughter's allergy symptoms decreased dramatically. Their technicians were extremely thorough, removing years of accumulated dust and pet dander that our previous service provider had missed. The air in our 3-bedroom colonial home feels noticeably fresher, and our heating bills have decreased by 15% this winter!"

      location: "Stamford, CT",
      rating: 5,
      review: "As someone who operates a small daycare from my home, maintaining clean indoor air is essential. DuctBuddy's comprehensive air duct and dryer vent cleaning service eliminated the musty odor we'd been struggling with for months. Their professional team explained every step of the process and showed me the surprising amount of debris they removed from our 10-year-old HVAC system."

      location: "Hoboken, NJ",
      rating: 5,
      review: "After renovating our pre-war apartment, construction dust was circulating throughout our home despite regular cleaning. DuctBuddy's residential air duct cleaning service removed all construction residue from our ductwork, significantly improving our indoor air quality. Their technicians were knowledgeable about older HVAC systems and provided valuable maintenance tips."
